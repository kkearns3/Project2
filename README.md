# Project2

## About the App

This app allows a user to access PUMS data for the year 2023 in the state of North Carolina. 


## Future releases

Potential improvements that can be done with a reasonable amount of edits, but are outside the scope of the project include:
- Expanding the analysis to additional states and/or years
- Accessing data through an API call, allowing customization of which columns are included
- Designing more custom data fields from existing data, e.g. determining geographical movements of individuals through analysis of which PUMA they work in or previously lived in vs. where they live now
